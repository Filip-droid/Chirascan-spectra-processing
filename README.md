## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** designed to automate the processing of raw spectroscopic data generated by Chirascan instrument

The tool solves a critical inefficiency in laboratory workflows by replacing manual data entry with an automated script that batch-processes hundreds of raw CSV files, performs data cleaning, and aggregates results into structured Excel reports for downstream analysis.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automated Data Ingestion:** Recursively scans directories to identify and parse instrument-generated CSV files.
* **Dynamic Metadata Extraction:** intelligently parses unstructured file headers to extract measurement dates and metadata using generator expressions.
* **Robust Data Cleaning:** Handles inconsistent file formats, missing values, and varying header lengths using robust parsing logic.
* **Batch Aggregation:** Merges spectral data based on measurement timestamps into unified Pandas DataFrames.
* **Reporting:** Exports clean, structured data into a multi-sheet Excel file (`.xlsx`) optimized for statistical analysis in Origin/Prism.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **File Handling:** OS, Glob, Pathlib
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib (for quick data validation)
* **Export:** OpenPyXL
